    <h1 class="heading">What is acacia sensu lato</h1>
    <p>
	The leaves of acacias are compound pinnate in general.
	In some species, however, more especially in the Australian
	and Pacific Islands species, the leaflets are suppressed,
	and the leaf-stalks (petioles) become vertically flattened
	in order to serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as
	“phyllodes”. The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects
	them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky
	and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed
	leaves. A few species lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead
	possess cladodes, modified leaf-like photosynthetic stems functioning
	as leaves.

	<h1 class="heading">uses of Acacia sensu lato:</h2>
        <h2 class="subHeading">1. Used as human food.</h2>
        <p>
		Acacia seeds are often used for food and a variety of other products.
		In Myanmar, Loas and Thailand, the feathery shoots of Acacia pennata (common name cha-om, su pout ywet in Burmese) are used in soups, curries, omelettes, and stir-fries
		</p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">2. Uses in folk medicine</h2>
        <p>
		Acacia species have possible uses in folk medicine.
		A 19th-century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made
		from an Ethiopian species (known as grar) mixed with the root
		of the tacha, then boiled, as a cure for rabies. 
		An astringent medicine high in tannins, called catechu or cutch,
		is procured from several species, but more especially
		fromSenegalia catechu (syn. Acacia catechu), by boiling down
		the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.
		The catechu extract from A. catechu figures in the history of
		chemistry in giving its name to the catechin, catechol and
		catecholamine chemical families ultimately derived from it.
		</p>
        <h2 class="subHeading">3. Ornamental uses</h2>
        <p>
		A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens;
		the most popular perhaps is A. dealbata, with its attractive
		glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is
		erroneously known as "mimosa" in some areas where it is
		cultivated, through confusion with the related genus Mimosa.
		Ornamental species of acacias are also used by homeowners and
		landscape architects for home security. The sharp thorns of some
		species are a deterrent to trespassing, and may prevent break-ins
		if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic
		characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home
		security qualities, makes them a reasonable alternative to
		constructed fences and walls.
