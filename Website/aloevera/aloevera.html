    <p>
      You can apply fresh aloe gel directly to your skin or follow a recipe to
      make a homemade beauty product. It can also be added to food, smoothies,
      and drinks.  To make aloe juice , use 1 cup of liquid for every 2
      tablespoons of aloe gel. Include any other ingredients, like fruit, and
      use a blender or food processor to mix up your drink.  If you’re planning
      to consume the fresh slices of aloe gel, it will keep in the refrigerator
      for a few days, but its best to consume it as quickly as possible. You can
      always store aloe vera gel in the freezer if you’re not ready to use it
      right away.
