    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
      The species to which the Areca palm belongs is the Areca Catechu. This
      species grows in the tropical pacific, asia and parts of east Africa.
      There are different names for the species, such as Areca palm, betel palm,
      Indian nut and many more. The name betel tree resulted from the Areca nut,
      which is chewed with the Betel leaf. The name Areca comes from the Malabar
      Coast of India and catechu from caccu, another Malay name for palm.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Characteristics</h1>
    <p>
      The areca palm is a medium sized palm tree, which can grow up to 20m in
      height. The trunk is small varying from 10cm till 15 cm in diameter. Its
      leaves can grow till 1,5m till 2 m long and the branch with the leaves
      have a pinnate shape. The fruit is oval shaped, orange colored and bears a
      hard single seed.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subHeading">Maintenance</h1>
    <p>
      Maintenance Moderate. Apply good quality palm fertilizer that has
      continuous release formula twice a year during the growing season.
      Chrysalidocarpus lutescens does not age well. When new, it has an upright
      appearance, but with time the new fronds become heavy and bent, and the
      plant spreads out. Tips of the Areca Palm Tree may also turn brown, but
      don’t worry because browning tips of the palm are normal. One main area to
      beware of with this palm is that you should only prune off dead branches.
      If you clip the browned tips you might stop the growth of that branch.

    <p>
      A common pest to this plant is the spider mite. If the appearance of
      spider mites is present, try misting the plant twice daily with a soapy
      water mixture. If this does not work, go to your local plant or hardware
      store and try a professional-grade pest remover. Overall this plant
      doesn’t require a great deal of attention to maintain its beautiful
      appearance.
