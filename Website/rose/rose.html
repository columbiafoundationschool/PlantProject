      Rose, (genus Rosa), genus of some 100 species of perennial shrubs in the
      rose family (Rosaceae). Roses are native primarily to the temperate
      regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Many roses are cultivated for their
      beautiful flowers, which range in colour from white through various tones
      of yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon, and most have a delightful
      fragrance, which varies according to the variety and to climatic
      conditions. Most rose species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers
      being native to North America and a few to Europe and northwest Africa.
      Roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, giving rise
      to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult to
      determine basic species. Fewer than 10 species, mostly native to Asia,
      were involved in the crossbreeding that ultimately produced today's many
      types of garden roses.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Physical description</h1>
    <p>
      Roses are erect, climbing, or trailing shrubs, the stems of which are
      usually copiously armed with prickles of various shapes and sizes,
      commonly called thorns. The leaves are alternate and pinnately
      compound(i.e., feather-formed), usually with oval leaflets that are
      sharply toothed. The flowers of wild roses usually have five petals,
      whereas the flowers of cultivated roses are often double (i.e., with
      multiple sets of petals). Rose flowers size ranges from tiny miniatures
      1.25 cm (0.5 inch) in diameter to hybrid flowers measuring more than 17.5
      cm (7 inches) across. The rose plants fleshy, sometimes edible, berrylike
      fruit (actually the floral cup) is known as a hip and usually ranges from
      red to orange in colour. Roses can become infected by a number of
      diseases, most of them caused by fungi. Powdery mildew appears as a
      grayish white moldlike growth on the surface of young leaves and stems.
      Black spot fungus appears as conspicuous black spots on leaves and causes
      them to fall off. Rust is also a common disease of roses. Aphids are a
      common insect pest on the leaves and young stems.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses of rose:</h1>
    <p>
      Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the
      garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial
      perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape
      plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover
      and slope stabilization.

      <p>
        The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their
        flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented
        foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns
        (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
        Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest
        known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean
        countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand
        rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as
        flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the
        stamens having morphed into additional petals.

      <li>Medicine</li>
      <p>
        The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of
        vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of
        vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been
        used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in
        Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for
        stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer
        growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon is a name given to various compounds in which
        red roses are an ingredient.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Symbolism of Roses</h1>
    <p>
      A single red rose is the classic token of love, but other types of roses
      have their own way of professing different emotions. Pink roses, for
      example, can signify happiness or a desire to be believed. A white rose
      can symbolize innocence or purity, and a yellow rose can signify a loss of
      love. A red rosebud can signify purity, and a white rosebud can symbolize
      girlhood. By contrast, a bouquet of mature blooms can represent deep
      gratitude. In the early 20th century, the phrase "sub-rosa," meaning
      "under the rose," came into popularity. It was used to indicate secrecy or
      privacy due to the ancient tradition of using a rose during a meeting to
      symbolize the confidence of the participants.
