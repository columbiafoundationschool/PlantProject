    <p>
      Buddleja davidii (spelling variant Buddleia davidii), also called summer
      lilac, butterfly-bush, or orange eye, is a species of flowering plant in
      the family Scrophulariaceae, native to Sichuan and Hubei provinces in
      central China, and also Japan. It is widely used as an ornamental plant,
      and many named varieties are in cultivation. The genus was named Buddleja
      after Reverend Adam Buddle, an English botanist. The species name davidii
      honors the French missionary and explorer in China, Father Armand David,
      who was the first European to report the shrub. It was found near Ichang
      by Dr Augustine Henry about 1887 and sent to St Petersburg. Another
      botanist-missionary in China, Jean-André Soulié, sent seed to the French
      nursery Vilmorin, and B. davidii entered commerce in the 1890s.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description:</h1>
    <p>
      Buddleja davidii is a vigorous shrub with an arching habit, growing to 5 m
      in height. The pale brown bark becomes deeply fissured with age. The
      branches are quadrangular in section, the younger shoots covered in a
      dense indumentum. The opposite lanceolate leaves are 7–13 cm long,
      tomentose beneath when young. The honey-scented lilac to purple
      inflorescences are terminal panicles. Flowers are perfect (having both
      male and female parts), hence are hermaphrodite rather than monoecious
      (separate male and female flowers on the same plant) as is often
      incorrectly stated.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Cultivation:</h1>
    <p>
      Buddleja davidii cultivars are much appreciated worldwide as ornamentals
      and for the value of their flowers as a nectar source for many species of
      butterfly. However, the plant does not provide food for butterfly larvae,
      and buddlejas might out-compete the host plants that caterpillars require.
