    <p>
      The Rangoon creeper is a ligneous vine that can reach from 2.5 meters to
      up to 8 meters. The leaves are elliptical with an acuminate tip and a
      rounded base. They grow from 7 to 15 centimeters and their arrangement is
      opposite. The flowers are fragrant and tubular and their color varies from
      white to pink to red. The 30 to 35 mm long fruit is ellipsoidal and has
      five prominent wings. The fruit tastes like almonds when mature.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description:</h1>
    <p>
      Rangoon creeper is found in thickets or secondary forests of the
      Philippines, India, Pakistan and Malaysia. It has since been cultivated
      and naturalized in tropical areas such as Bangladesh, Burma, Vietnam, and
      Thailand. The flowers change in colour with age and it is thought that
      this is a strategy to gather more pollinators. The flower is initially
      white and opens at dusk. This attracts hawkmoths with long tongues for
      pollination. On the second day it turns pink and on the third it turns red
      attracting day flying bees and birds. The flower also changes from a
      horizontal orientation to a drooping pose.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses:</h1>
    <p>
      The seeds of this and related species, Quisqualis fructus and Q.
      chinensis, contain the chemical quisqualic acid, which is an agonist for
      the AMPA receptor, a kind of glutamate receptor in the brain. The chemical
      is linked to excitotoxicity (cell death). The seeds have been used for
      treating roundworm and pinworm. It is toxic to the parasite and kills it
      in the digestive tract.
