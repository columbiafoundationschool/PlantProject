    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Dombeya is a flowering plant genus. Traditionally included in the family
      Sterculiaceae, it is included in the expanded Malvaceae in the APG and
      most subsequent systematics. These plants are known by a number of
      vernacular names which sometimes, misleadingly, allude to the superficial
      similarity of flowering Dombeya to pears or hydrangeas (which are
      unrelated). Therefore, the genus as a whole is often simply called
      dombeyas. The generic name commemorates Joseph Dombey (1742â€“1794), a
      French botanist and explorer in South America, involved in the notorious
      "Dombey affair", embroiling scientists and governments of France, Spain,
      and Britain for more than two years.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      These plants grow chiefly throughout Africa and Madagascar. Madagascar has
      the majority of species, with approximately 175 native species. 19 are
      found on the African mainland, with one, Dombeya torrida, also extending
      into the southwestern Arabian Peninsula. 24 species are native to the
      Mascarene Islands, of which 23 are endemic to the islands. Dombeya
      acutangula is native to east Africa, Madagascar, and the Mascarenes, with
      a disjunct population in Laos in Southeast Asia.
