    <h1 class="heading">What is Vitex negundo</h1>
    <p>
      Vitex negundo, commonly known as the Chinese chaste tree,five-leaved
      chaste tree, or horseshoe vitex, or nisinda is a large aromatic shrub with
      quadrangular, densely whitish, tomentose branchlets. It is widely used in
      fold medicine, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. Vitex negundo is
      an erect shrub or small tree growing from 2 to 8 m (6.6 to 26.2 ft) in
      height. The bark is reddish brown. Its leaves are digitate, with five
      lanceolate leaflets, sometimes three. Each leaflet is around 4 to 10 cm
      (1.6 to 3.9 in) in length, with the central leaflet being the largest and
      possessing a stalk. The leaf edges are toothed or serrated and the bottom
      surface is covered in hair.The numerous flowers are borne in panicles 10
      to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) in length. Each is around 6 to 7 cm (2.4 to 2.8
      in) long and are white to blue in color. The petals are of different
      lengths, with the middle lower lobe being the longest. Both the corolla
      and calyx are covered in dense hairs. The fruit is a succulent drupe, 4 mm
      (0.16 in) in diameter, rounded to egg-shaped. It is black or purple when
      ripe.

    <h1 class="heading">Who discovered Vitex negundo?</h2>
    <p>
      One such innovation came in 1995, when NIRPROMP isolated vitex negundo, a
      large, hardy, five-leaved aromatic shrub with bluish-purple flowers, as a
      natural source for developing an effective herbal medicine.
    </p>
    <h1 class="heading">How do you grow Vitex negundo?</h2>
    <p>
      Preference is full sun and loose, moist, well-drained soil. Flowers appear
      on 5-8 Inch panicles in mid to late summer. Deadhead to encourage more
      blooms. It is native habitat, it can be found growing in wastelands of the
      Himalayas and mixed thickets on mountain slopes with elevations from 600
      to 6500 feet.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeading">Agricultural uses:</h2>
    <h3>1. Growth promoter</h3>
    <p>
      Ancient treatises mention the promotion of growth of newly planted trees
      by fumigation and smearing with unmatta (Datura metel), vatarika (Allium
      sativum), mallika (Jasminum sambac), sinduvara, tila (sesame), masha
      (black gram), yava (Hordeum vulgare), clarifi ed butter, and honey mixed
      in milk (Sadhale, 1996; Sadhale, 2004). Nowadays, in Tamil Nadu, a mixture
      of the extract of V. negundo (nochi) leaves and neem cake is sprayed to
      control the shedding of fl owers and premature fall of pods in fi eld bean
      (Sundaramari and Ranganathan, 2003).
    </p>
    <h3>2. Manure</h3>
    <p>
      Green leaves of many non-nitrogen-fi xing plants and V. negundo are used
      for leaf manure (Watt, 1892; Pereira, 1993). Twigs and leaves of nochi
      along with leaves of Calotropis gigantea, Cassia auriculata,
      Gliricidiamaculata, and Tephrosia purpurea are used in manuring in some
      parts of Tamil Nadu (Ayyavu, 1995).
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeading">Household pesticide</h2>
    <p>
      Dry V. negundo leaves are traditionally placed with stored woolen garments
      since the leaves repel wool-destroying insects and worms. Dry leaves are
      used for storing cotton and warm clothes in Hazaribagh. Leaves are burnt
      in a fi re during the rainy season to keep mosquitoes away from animals
      and human beings; the smoke repels mosquitoes and insects (Ghosh, 2000;
      Guleria and Vasisth, 2009). The Lodha tribe uses dry leaf powder for
      repelling bedbugs (Pal and Jain, 1998). Dry leaf powder alone or mixed
      with dhoop smoke repels mosquitoes (Tarafdar, 1983).
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeading">Traditional use in plant disease and pest control:</h2>
    <p>
      Vitex negundo has been used in the management of plant diseases to control
      wind disorders of trees since ancient times. Vishvavallabha (written by
      Chakrapani Mishra who worked under the patronage of Maharana Pratap around
      1577 CE) refers to fumigation with a mixture of nigundika, guggul
      (Commiphora wightii), and oil cake at the root to obtain favorable results
      in the treatment of wind diseases. Vishvavallabha also mentions that a
      frostbitten tree can produce plenty of shoots if treated with cow dung
      ash, and by sprinkling a decoction of nirgundika (Sadhale, 2004).
    </p>
    <h3>1. Medicinal importance</h3>
    <p>
      In India, nirgundi is used in Ayurveda, folk, Siddha, Tibetan, and Unani
      systems of medicine (Udayan and Indirabalachandran, 2009; Vishwanathan and
      Basavaraju, 2010). It is interesting that it is also dispensed in
      homeopathy and allopathic systems of medicine. Myriad medicinal properties
      have been ascribed to Vitex and the plant has also been extensively used
      in the treatment of a plethora of ailments.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Use in Ayurveda</h3>
    <p>
      In Ayurveda, sindhuvara has been used as medicine since ancient times.
      Nirgundi is used in a variety of ways, both internally and externally. The
      plant fi nds mention in the verses of the Charaka Samhita which is beyond
      all doubt the most ancient and authoritative textbook of Indian Ayurveda.
      Vitex has been designated as an anthelmintic and is prescribed as a
      vermifuge. Vitex has been used in postnatal care as it brings the uterus
      to its original size and reduces swelling. It is also useful in the first
      stage of gonorrhea, increases digestion, useful in sciatica, slip disc,
      and swelling of muscles, increases sexual power and cures the weakness of
      penis, reduces common weakness, makes one free from diseases, increases
      age, reduces cough, fever, swelling of lungs and spleen, heals wounds, and
      is also useful in eye diseases (Balkishan, 2008). The plant is reported to
      have expectorant, carminative, digestive, anodyne, antiseptic, alterant,
      antipyretic, diuretic and emmenagogue, depurative, rejuvenating,
      ophthalmic, vulnerary, and tonic properties. The Madanapahala Nighantu
      states specifi cally that nirgundi is a promoter of memory. Patkar (2008)
      refers to the formulations described in Anubhoga Vaidya Bhaga, a
      compendium of formulations in cosmetology, in outlining the use of Vitex
      leaves along with those of Azadirachta indica, Eclipta alba, Sphaeranthus
      indicus, and Carum copticum (syn. Trachyspermum ammi) in a notable
      rejuvenation treatment known as Kayakalpa.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Unani medicine</h3>
    <p>
      Vitex, commonly known as nisinda in Unani medicine, fi nds use in many
      applications (Khare, 2004). The seeds are administered internally with
      sugarcane vinegar for removal of swellings. Powdered seeds are used in
      spermatorrhea and serve as an aphrodisiac when dispensed along with dry
      ginger (Zingiber offi cinale) and milk.
    </p>
    <h3>4. As folk medicine in India</h3>
    <p>
      The Vitex plant is used as a folk medicine in Bangladesh, India, China,
      Indo-China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka
      (Perry, 1980; Vishwanathan and Basavaraju, 2010). Various tribes in India
      use the leaves, juice of leaves, boiled leaf water, dry leaf powder, leaf
      extract, oil, fl owers, stem, roots, and fruits of V. negundo to treat
      various affl ictions (Table 2). Tarafdar (1983) has listed 33 uses of V.
      negundo by tribals of Hazaribagh, Bihar. It is used as folk medicine in
      diseases such as asthma, jaundice, urticaria, abscesses, carbuncles,
      eczema, and liver disorders in Assam; wounds and body ache in Himachal
      Pradesh; toothache, febrile catarrh, rheumatic afflictions, and migraine
      in Karnataka; rheumatism, encephalitis, joint pain and as expectorant in
      Maharashtra; jaundice in Odisha; as an antidote to snakebite, respiratory
      disorders, fever, sinus problem, and headache in Tamil Nadu; and in eye
      pain and 48 other ailments in Uttar Pradesh (Vishwanathan and Basavaraju,
      2010). In the Dharward district of Karnataka, leaves are used in the
      treatment of impotency, crack foot, bone fracture, and paralysis (Hegde
      and Hebbar, 2009).
    </p>
    <h1 class="heading">Contraindications</h2>
    <p>
      Vitex negundo is quite similar botanically to the better studied V.
      agnus-castus, and thus may have a similar range of contraindications,
      including the concurrent use of progesterogenic drugs and
      hormonereplacement therapies. Vitex promotes production of progesterone in
      the second half of the cycle. Also known as a contraceptive, it should not
      be taken before ovulation, as it may delay or prevent ovulation. The juice
      of the leaves is dangerous to young people as it brings down sexual
      emotions. Experimental data on animals and human studies have reported
      that phytocomponents of Vitex exhibit hormonal activities and may affect
      the pharmacological effects of hormonal medications. Reports indicate that
      Vitex affects endocrinal activity and may alter effects of medications and
      possibly doses needed for treatment
      (www.ovarian-cystspcos.com/vitex.html). Vitex may decrease the
      effect/effectiveness of oral contraceptives or female hormone replacement
      therapy. People with hormone dependent conditions as endometriosis, fi
      broids or cancers of the breast, uterus, and prostrate should not take it
      and it is not recommended during pregnancy. Small doses may increase milk
      production in females and high doses may decrease it. Dopaminergic effects
      of Vitex may be partly responsible for its prolactininhibiting actions and
      variable degree of binding occurs between crude extracts and diterpene
      fractions of Vitex. People with schizophrenia or where dopamine levels are
      affected should use Vitex under supervision of health professionals
      (Padmalatha et al., 2009).
