    <p>
      Bamboos are a diverse group of evergreen perennial flowering plants in the
      subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the
      largest members of the grass family. The origin of the word "bamboo" is
      uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or Portuguese language,
      which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada. In bamboo, as in other
      grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the
      vascular bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout the stem
      instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is
      also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of
      monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather
      than tapering.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Distribution:</h1>
    <p>
      Most bamboo species are native to warm and moist tropical and to warm
      temperate climates. However, many species are found in diverse climates,
      ranging from hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions and highland
      cloud forests. In the Asia-Pacific region they occur across East Asia,
      from north to 50 N latitude in Sakhalin, to south to northern Australia,
      and west to India and the Himalayas. China, Japan, Korea, India and
      Australia, all have several endemic populations. They also occur in small
      numbers in sub-Saharan Africa, confined to tropical areas, from southern
      Senegal in the north to southern Mozambique and Madagascar in the south.
      In the Americas, bamboo has a native range from 47 S in southern Argentina
      and the beech forests of central Chile, through the South American
      tropical rainforests, to the Andes in Ecuador near 4,300 m (14,000 ft).
      Bamboo is also native through Central America and Mexico, northward into
      the Southeastern United States. Canada and continental Europe are not
      known to have any native species of bamboo. As garden plants, many species
      grow readily outside these ranges, including most of Europe and the United
      States.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Cultivation:</h1>
    <p>
      Bamboo forestry (also known as bamboo farming, cultivation, agriculture or
      agroforestry) is a cultivation and raw material industry that provides the
      raw materials for the broader bamboo industry, worth over 72 billion
      dollars globally in 2019. Historically, a dominant raw material in
      South and South East Asia, the global bamboo industry has significantly
      grown in recent decades in part because of the high sustainability of
      bamboo as compared to other biomass cultivation strategies, such as
      traditional timber forestry. For example, as of 2016, the U.S. Fiber
      corporation Resource Fiber is contracting farmers in the United States for
      bamboo cultivation.Or in 2009, United Nations Industrial
      Development Organization published guidelines for cultivation of bamboo in
      semi-arid climates in Ethiopia and Kenya.
