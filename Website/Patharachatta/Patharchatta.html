    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
        In the elements of nature, plants are the indispensable for a lively environment. Among them there are various
        plants which are considered as the wondrous gifts by nature. They support and soothe us in our good and the bad
        times.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Physical description</h1>
    <p>
        The leaves of this species are thick, fleshy, elliptical in shape, curved, with a crenate or serrated margin,
        often reddish. Simple at the base of the stem, the leaves are imparipinnate at the top, 10–30 cm (4–12 in) long,
        with three to five pairs of fleshy limb lobes.

        The leaves are remarkable for their ability to produce bulbils. At their margin, between the teeth, adventitious
        buds appear, which produce roots, stems and leaves. When the plantlets fall to the ground, they root and can
        become larger plants. This is a fairly common trait in the section Bryophyllum. The fruits are follicles (10–15
        mm) which are found in the persistent calyx and corolla.
