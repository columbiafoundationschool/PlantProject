    <p>
      The Bottle Palm Tree, scientific name Hyophorbe lagenicaulis, is one of
      the most desired palms in Florida. Many consider bottle palm to be a dwarf
      palm. This palm is easy to grow and maintain. It got its name from
      bottle-shaped trunk. It is great for indoors or small outside garden.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subHeading">Appearance</h1>
    <p>
      Hyophorbe lagenicaulis has a single, trunk, about 2ft in diameter with
      ring scars and a green crownshaft at the top. The gray, self-cleaning
      trunk is bottle-shaped, hence the name Bottle Palm. The Bottle Palm has a
      small crown of 4 to 8 pinnate, or feather-like, leaves that can grow up to
      10ft. It has 140 leaflets arranged in two upward-pointing rows which grow
      to about 2ft long.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Flowers and Fruit</h1>
    <p>
      The Bottle Palm produces beautiful white flowers that are held by 30 in.
      stalks coming from below the crownshaft. Flowers are monoecious, male and
      female flowers on the same inflorescence. Flowers are followed by
      green-black berry-like fruits that turn black when ripe. Oval-shaped fruit
      is around 1.5 inches long and contains a single seed inside.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subHeading">Growth Rate</h1>
    <p>
      This is a slow-growing palm that can get up to 10 – 20 ft tall and 10 – 15
      ft wide, but usually is much shorter around 10ft.
