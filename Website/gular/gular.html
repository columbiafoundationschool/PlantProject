    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gular, the cluster fig, red river fig or gular, is a species of plant in
      the family Moraceae. It is native to Australia and tropical Asia. It is a
      fast-growing plant with large, very rough leaves, usually attaining the
      size of a large shrub, although older specimens can grow quite large and
      gnarled. It is unusual in that its figs grow on or close to the tree
      trunk, termed cauliflory. The fruits are commonly eaten as a vegetable
      after the seeds have been discarded, and made into stir-fries and curries.
      The fruits are a favourite staple of the common Indian macaque. It serves
      as a food plant for the caterpillars of the two-brand crow butterfly
      (Euploea sylvester) of northern Australia.

    <p>
      In Ayurveda, the gular tree is one of the four trees of the Nalpamara or
      Nalpamaram. The gular tree is astringent in nature with anti-inflammatory,
      antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiasthmatic, anti-ulcer, antipyretic and
      anti-diarrheal in response. It balances Kapha and pitta dosha. The active
      ingredients present in gular include tannin, wax, beta-sitosterol,
      leucocyanidin, lupeol, stigmasterol, glucose, tiglic acid, friedelin and
      racemosic acid. It is rich in vitamin B2, iron, copper, potassium and
      magnesium.
