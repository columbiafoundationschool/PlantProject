    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Pilkhan is a plant of the genus Pilkhan found in Pakistan, India,
      southeast Asia, through Malaysia and into Northern Australia. Its common
      name is white fig; it is locally known as pilkhan and in the Kunwinjku
      language it is called manbornde. Like many figs, its fruits are edible.
      One of the most famous specimens of this tree is the Curtain Fig Tree of
      the Atherton Tableland, near Cairns, a popular tourist attraction. Another
      famous example is the Tree of Knowledge in Darwin.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Description:</h2>
    <p>
      It is a medium-sized tree which grows to a height of 24–27 metres (79–89
      ft) In dry areas and up to 32 metres (105 ft) tall in wetter areas. It is
      a fig tree belonging to the group of trees known as strangler figs, which
      is because its seeds can germinate on other trees and grow to strangle and
      eventually kill the host tree. It has two marked growth periods in its
      Indian environment: in spring (February to early May), and in the time of
      the monsoon rains (i.e. June to early September). The new leaves are a
      beautiful shade of reddish pink and very pleasing to the eye.
