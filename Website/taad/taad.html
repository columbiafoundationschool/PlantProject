    <p>
      Borassus flabellifer, commonly known as doub palm, palmyra palm, tala or
      tal palm, toddy palm, wine palm or ice apple, is native to South Asia
      (especially in Bangladesh & South India) and Southeast Asia. It is
      reportedly naturalized in Socotra and parts of China.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description</h1>
    <p>
      Borassus flabellifer is a robust tree and can reach a height of 30 metres
      (98 ft). The trunk is grey, robust and ringed with leaf scars; old leaves
      remain attached to the trunk for several years before falling cleanly. The
      leaves are fan-shaped and 3 m (9.8 ft) long, with robust black teeth on
      the petiole margins. Like all Borassus species, B. flabellifer is
      dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The male
      flowers are less than 1 cm long and form semi-circular clusters, which are
      hidden beneath scale-like bracts within the catkin-like inflorescences. In
      contrast, the female flowers are golfball-sized and solitary, sitting upon
      the surface of the inflorescence axis. After pollination, these blooms
      develop into fleshy fruits 15â€“25 cm wide, each containing 1-3 seeds. The
      fruits are black to brown with sweet, fibrous pulp and each seed is
      enclosed within a woody endocarp. Young palmyra seedlings grow slowly,
      producing only a few leaves each year (establishment phase), but at an as
      yet undetermined time, they grow rapidly, producing a substantial stem.

      This is a mass savior of rain water or natural rain water harvester it's
      roots helps to stop soil erosion, it also helps in increase in ground
      water leaves can be made as roof , its trunk is used in brick making
      industries because it gives long lasting moderate heat .
