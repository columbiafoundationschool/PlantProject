    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Mango, Mangifera indica, is an evergreen tree in the family Anacardiaceae
      grown for its edible fruit. The mango tree is erect and branching with a
      thick trunk and broad, rounded canopy. The leaves of the tree are are
      shiny and dark green. They are either elliptical or lanceolate with long
      petioles and a leathery texture. The tree produces dense clusters of
      flowers with cream-pink petals on branched panicles. The mango fruit is
      roughly oval in shape, with uneven sides. The fruit is a drupe, with an
      outer flesh surrounding a stone. The flesh is soft and bright
      yellow-orange in color. The skin of the fruit is yellow-green to red.
      Mango trees can grow to a height of 45 m (148 ft) and can live for in
      excess of 100 years. Mango is believed to originate from India or Burma
      (Myanmar).
