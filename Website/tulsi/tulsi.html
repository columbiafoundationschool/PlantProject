    <h2 class="subHeading">Side Effects of Tulsi:</h2>
    <p>
      Regardless of dose, formulation, age, or gender of participants, all the
      studies done so far with Tulsi revealed favourable therapeutic outcomes
      with minimum or no side effects. Only one clinical trial reported
      transient mild nausea. As the trial was only 13 weeks long, the failure to
      detect any negative effects does not rule out the possibility of long-term
      side effects. However, the traditional history of Tulsi usage implies that
      any major long-term effects are rare and that daily consumption is safe.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Where to Get Tulsi Supplement?</h2>
    <p>
      Tulsi, the queen of herbs can be bought from a market near you, but again
      most of it may not be 100% organic. This is because farmers grow tulsi on
      soil that may have pre-existing chemicals in it. So, now that tulsi is
      grown on such chemical soil, is it organic or herbal. This herb is said to
      produce benefits and no side effects. But if it is grown on soil thats
      containing chemicals, what guarantee is there that you wont develop any
      side effects. Our air is filled with a lot of toxins and this can cause
      cold, cough and fever. The answer to this is Tulsi. We at Medlife have
      created a 100% herbal tulsi in the form of a tablet that can bid goodbye
      to your common cold, cough and fever.

    <h2 class="subHeading">How to store tulsi leaves?</h2>
    <p>
      Fresh tulsi leaves can be stored in the refrigerator for few days. Before
      refrigeration, clean and wrap them tightly in a plastic film or store in
      an air-tight container. It is best to use fresh leaves within a day or two
      after they have been plucked as they tend to wither and lose their aroma
      and flavour soon.
