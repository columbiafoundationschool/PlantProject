      Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, also known as the Night-flowering jasmine or
      Parijat (Parvati chi phula), is a species of Nyctanthes native to South
      Asia and Southeast Asia. Nyctanthes arbor-tristis is a shrub or a small
      tree growing to 10 m (33 ft) tall, with flaky grey bark. The leaves are
      opposite, simple, 6–12 cm (2.4–4.7 in) long and 2–6.5 cm (0.79–2.56 in)
      broad, with an entire margin. The flowers are fragrant, with a five- to
      eight-lobed white corolla with an orange-red centre; they are produced in
      clusters of two to seven together, with individual flowers opening at dusk
      and finishing at dawn. The fruit is a bilobed, flat brown heart-shaped to
      round capsule 2 cm (0.79 in) diameter, each lobe containing a single seed.

    <p>
      The tree is sometimes called the "tree of sorrow", because the flowers
      lose their brightness during daytime; the scientific name arbor-tristis
      also means "sad tree". The flowers can be used as a source of yellow dye
      for clothing. The flower is called Gangaseuli and some where Jharaa
      sephali in Odisha, India. In the Borok Tipruri culture, it is associated
      with the cycle of life, i.e., birth and dying. It is popularly used as a
      garland for the dead.
