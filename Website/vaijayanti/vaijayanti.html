    <p>
      The Vaijayanti (Vyjayanti) is a theological flower, offered to Vishnu or
      Krishna in worship as a garland called Vaijayantimala or Vana-mala.
      Literally meaning, "the garland of victory", Vaijayanti-mala also finds
      mention in Vishnu sahasranama, a stotra dedicated to Vishnu in the
      Mahabharata, as vanamali (forest flowers). The garland of victory
      mentioned in the Mahabharata was made of never-wilting lotuses
      (1.57.15-16); however, many flowers are currently believed to be the
      Vaijayanti, including Job's Tears. The latter is sometimes mistaken with
      the original Vaijayanti. The original Vaijayanti plant looks like long
      grass and hence is difficult to identify, till flowering or seeds start
      growing in it.

      Sahasranama as the Vanamali. Mostly Vaijanti Mala used to worship the Lord
