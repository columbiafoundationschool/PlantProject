      hibiscus, (genus Hibiscus), genus of numerous species of herbs, shrubs,
      and trees in the mallow family (Malvaceae) that are native to warm
      temperate and tropical regions. Several are cultivated as ornamentals for
      their showy flowers, and a number are useful as fibre plants.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description:</h1>
    <p>
      The leaves are often lobed and may be smooth or covered in trichomes
      (plant hairs). The flowers can be borne singly or in clusters, and the
      flowers of many species last only a single day. An epicalyx (whorl of
      leaflike bracts that surrounds the sepals) is particularly common, and the
      stamens are typically fused into a tube. Members of the genus
      characteristically have spiny pollen, and their fruits are capsules.

      <h2 class="subHeading">Landscaping</h2>
      <p>
        Many species are grown for their showy flowers or used as landscape
        shrubs, and are used to attract butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.
        Hibiscus is a very hardy, versatile plant and in tropical conditions it
        can enhance the beauty of any garden. Being versatile it adapts itself
        easily to balcony gardens in crammed urban spaces and can be easily
        grown in pots as a creeper or even in hanging pots. It is a perennial
        and flowers throughout the year. As it comes in a variety of colors,
        it's a plant which can add vibrancy to any garden. The only infestation
        that gardeners need to be vigilant about is mealybugs. Mealybug
        infestations are easy to spot as they are clearly visible as a distinct
        white cottony infestation on buds, leaves or even stems. To protect the
        plant you need to trim away the infected part, spray with water, and
        apply an appropriate pesticide.
