    <p>
      Horseradish, Armoracia rusticana, is an herbaceous perennial plant in the
      family Brassicaceae that is cultivated for its large, edible root. The
      leaves of the plant grow in a distinctive rosette pattern sprouting from
      single or multiple stems. The leaves have long petioles and can be smooth
      or crinkled, reaching 30–100 cm in length. The taproot is thick and fleshy
      and cylindrical in shape and can reach 50 cm in length. The plant produces
      many white flowers on racemes. Horseradish plants are usually grown as
      annuals, surviving only one growing season and can reach a height of 1.5
      m. Horseradish may also be referred to as red cole or pepper rod and
      originates from south-eastern Europe and western Asia.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Cultivation:</h1>
    <p>
      Horseradish is perennial in hardiness zones 2–9 and can be grown as an
      annual in other zones, although not as successfully as in zones with both
      a long growing season and winter temperatures cold enough to ensure plant
      dormancy. After the first frost in autumn kills the leaves, the root is
      dug and divided. The main root is harvested and one or more large
      offshoots of the main root are replanted to produce next year's crop.
      Horseradish left undisturbed in the garden spreads via underground shoots
      and can become invasive. Older roots left in the ground become woody,
      after which they are no longer culinarily useful, although older plants
      can be dug and re-divided to start new plants.The early season leaves can
      be distinctively different, asymmetric spiky, before the mature typical
      flat broad leaves start to be developed.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses</h1>
    <p>
      Horseradish is grown as a vegetable and can be eaten fresh or cooked. Due
      to its bitter taste, it is commonly used to make sauces which accompany
      meat or fish.
