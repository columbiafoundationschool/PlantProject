    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
      Agave amica, formerly Polianthes tuberosa, the tuberose, is a perennial
      plant in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae, extracts of which
      are used as a note in perfumery. Now widely grown as an ornamental plant,
      the species was originally native to Mexico.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description:</h1>
    <p>
      The tuberose is herbaceous, growing from underground tubers or tuberous
      roots. It produces offsets. The leaves are a dull green and about 1–1.5 ft
      long and up to 0.5 in wide at the base. They are slightly succulent. The
      inflorescence is a spike, reaching up to 3 ft high, with pure white waxy
      flowers. The flowers are tubular, with a tube up to 2.5 in long,
      separating into six flaring segments (tepals) at the end, and are strongly
      fragrant. There are six stamens, inserted into the tube of the flower, and
      a three-part stigma. The double-flowered cultivar 'The Pearl' has broader
      and darker leaves, and shorter flower spikes, usually reaching only 1.5–2
      ft. Orange-flowered forms of the species have been reported.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses:</h1>
    <p>
      The overwhelming fragrance of the tuberose has been distilled for use in
      perfumery since the 17th century, when the flower was first transported to
      Europe. French Queen Marie Antoinette used a perfume called Sillage de la
      Reine, also called Parfum de Trianon, containing tuberose, orange blossom,
      sandalwood, jasmine, iris, and cedar. It remains a popular floral note for
      perfumes, either in stand-alone Tuberose fragrances or mixed floral
      scents, but it generally must be used in moderation because the essence is
      overpowering and can become sickly to the wearer.
