    <h1 class="heading">What is Ashwagandha</h1>
    <p>
	Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), also known as Indian Ginseng, is an herb
	used in Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India. Its root has a horsey
	smell and is said to confer the strength and virility of a horse. In Sanskrit,
	ashva means “horse” and gandha means “smell.” Various parts of the plant are used,
	but the most common supplemental form is an extract of its roots.
	Ashwagandha is classified as an adaptogen, meaning it’s purported to
	enhance the body’s resilience to stress. Rodent and cell culture studies
	suggest that ashwagandha provides a wide range of health benefits, but there
	is a lack of direct evidence in humans to support most of these effects.

        <ul class="list">
            <li class="listItems">Stress-releving effects.</li>
            <li class="listItems">Improves sleep time. </li>
            <li class="listItems">Improves sleep quality</li>

            <li class="listItems">Helps in recovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="heading">How is ashwagandha taken?</h1>
        <p>Studies on ashwagandha have used dosages of 250–600 mg/day of
		a root extract. The most common dosing protocol is 600 mg/day
		divided into two doses, with one taken in the morning with
		breakfast and the other in the evening.
		</p>
		<p>
		It is unknown if ashwagandha loses its potency with daily
		long-term usage, but due to its possible drug-like effects
		on neurotransmission, this hypothesis cannot be ruled out. It’s
		also unknown if taking breaks from ashwagandha or taking it every
		other day influences its effectiveness.

            <li class="listItems">Make a fine paste of Giloy leaves.</li>

        <h1 class="heading">The Bottom Line</h1>
        <p>People have used giloy for many years in traditional medicine, including Ayurvedic medicine in India. It
            might be helpful if you want to support your immune system, fight off hay fever symptoms, or maintain
            healthy blood sugar levels. Unfortunately, there aren’t many studies to show if or how well it works in
            people. Some small studies in humans have focused on treating allergy symptoms or an itchy scabies rash.
            It’s probably safe for most people to take giloy, as long as you follow the directions on the product label.
            We don’t recommend it for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Be aware that if you take medicine to
            lower your blood sugar or if you have an autoimmune disease, giloy might cause an unwanted reaction. It’s
            always a good idea to talk with a healthcare professional before taking any herbal supplements.</p>
