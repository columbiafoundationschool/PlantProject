        <h1>What is giloy? </h1>
        <p>Giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) is a climbing shrub that grows on other trees, from the botanical family
            Menispermaceae. The plant is native to India but also found in China and tropical areas of Australia and
            Africa. It’s considered an essential herbal plant in Ayurvedic and folk medicine, where people use it as a
            treatment for a wide range of health conditions. All parts of the plant are used in Ayurvedic medicine.
            However, the stem is thought to have the most beneficial compounds. The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India has
            approved the plant’s stem for use in medicine. Giloy is also called giloe, guduchi, and amrita, among other
            names. The word “giloe” is a Hindu mythological term. It refers to a mythical heavenly elixir that keeps
            celestial beings eternally young.<br>
        </p>
            Traditionally, giloy is used to treat:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Urinary problems</li>
            <li>Asthma</li>
            <li>Skin infections</li>
            <li>Eye conditions</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Jaundice</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Downsides of using Giloy</h1>
        <p>There don’t seem to be any risks associated with giloy in healthy people, as long as you take it at the dose
            recommended on the product label or by a health professional. However, it may not be a good choice for
            certain people.
            Because it has the potential to lower blood sugar, you should be cautious with this herb if you take
            medications to lower your glucose. You might have a low blood sugar (hypoglycemic) reaction. Giloy could
            also potentially cause problems if you have an autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
            Crohn’s disease. This is because of its stimulating effects on the immune system. With autoimmunity, your
            immune system is already overstimulated. That causes it to attack certain healthy cells instead of harmful
            pathogens. Finally, giloy isn’t recommended for pregnant or lactating people. This is because not enough is
            known about how it works in humans. Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re considering taking it. We
            always recommend being cautious with herbal remedies. Just because they’re natural doesn’t always make them
            safe. Some can interact with certain medications or have unwanted side effects.<br>
            Benefits of Giloy<br>
        <h2>1. Wounds</h2>
        <p>Giloy helps in healing of wound, cuts or abrasions due to its Kashaya (astringent) and Ropan (healing)
            properties.<br>
        <p>Tip:</br>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a fine paste of Giloy leaves.</li>
            <li>Add honey or rose water to it.</li>
            <li>Apply it on the affected area and leave it for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Wash with plain water afterward.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>2. Eye Problem</h2>
        <p>Giloy reduces the risk of eye problems like burning sensation, redness
            and itching due to its Kashaya (astringent) and Ropan (healing) nature.
        <p>Tip:</br>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil some Giloy leaves in water.</li>
            <li>Let the water cool for some time.</li>
            <li>Apply this Giloy water over the eyelids.</li>
            <li>Wait for 10-15 minutes and wash your eyes with lukewarm water.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>3. Hair loss</h2>
        <p>Giloy helps to control hair loss and dandruff because of its Katu (pungent) and Kashaya (astringent) nature.
            Giloy also helps in hair growth due to its Rasayana (rejuvenating) properties.
        <p>Tip:</br>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a fine paste of Giloy leaves.</li>
            <li>Add honey or rose water to it.</li>
            <li>Apply it on the scalp and leave it for at least 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Wash it with any herbal shampoo.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>The bottom line</h1>
        <p>People have used giloy for many years in traditional medicine, including Ayurvedic medicine in India. It
            might be helpful if you want to support your immune system, fight off hay fever symptoms, or maintain
            healthy blood sugar levels. Unfortunately, there aren’t many studies to show if or how well it works in
            people. Some small studies in humans have focused on treating allergy symptoms or an itchy scabies rash.
            It’s probably safe for most people to take giloy, as long as you follow the directions on the product label.
            We don’t recommend it for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Be aware that if you take medicine to
            lower your blood sugar or if you have an autoimmune disease, giloy might cause an unwanted reaction. It’s
            always a good idea to talk with a healthcare professional before taking any herbal supplements.</p>
