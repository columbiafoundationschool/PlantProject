    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
      The lightest of all color, white is often considered plain and meek but
      there is something about its lightness that appeals to our simple
      aesthetic. White is a refreshing break from all the other popping and
      energetic colors. It emanates elegance without asking for too much as
      epitomized by white roses. The cultivation of white roses have established
      their importance, both in ornamental and medicinal horticulture. They also
      have made significant contributions to history, being associated with
      cultures and religions. All these prove that the story of white roses is
      never boring.

    <h1 class="subHeading">What Do White Roses Mean and Symbolize?</h1>
    <p>
      White is the simplest and purest of all colors and therefore, white roses
      are associated with purity and innocence. It was said that the early white
      roses existed as thornless plants symbolizing the good but when evil
      appeared in the world, roses started to acquire thorns. The white rose is
      entangled with religious history where they meant spirituality and
      sympathy. Many Christian architecture and paintings were lathered
      illustrations of white roses. The white rose is considered the Heavenâ€™s
      infinite eternal rose with the petals described as the souls and the
      fragrance the never-ending praise of God.

    <p>
      White roses are among the first roses that naturally existed and are the
      known ancestors of the modern roses. Roses have been cultivated for over
      5000 years and white roses are some of the flowers that breeders wanted to
      perfect. Along with red roses, white roses were grown by the early Romans
      to be used in creating rose water fountains and knee-deep carpet of rose
      petals. They became a status symbol and were synonymous with luxury.
