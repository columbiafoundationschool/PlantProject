    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Adenium obesum is a poisonous species of flowering plant belonging to the
      tribe Nerieae of the subfamily Apocynoideae of the dogbane family,
      Apocynaceae. It is native to the Sahel regions south of the Sahara (from
      Mauritania and Senegal to Sudan), tropical and subtropical eastern and
      southern Africa and also the Arabian Peninsula. Common names include Sabi
      star, kudu, mock azalea, impala lily and desert rose. Adenium obesum is a
      popular houseplant and bonsai in temperate regions.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      It is an evergreen or drought-deciduous succulent shrub (which can also
      lose its leaves during cold spells, or according to the subspecies or
      cultivar). It can grow to 0.12–5 m (0.39–16.40 ft) in height, with
      pachycaul (disproportionately large) stems and a stout, swollen basal
      caudex (a rootstock that protrudes from the soil). The leaves are spirally
      arranged, clustered toward the tips of the shoots, simple entire, leathery
      in texture, 5–15 cm (2.0–5.9 in) long and 1–8 cm (0.39–3.15 in) broad. The
      flowers are tubular, 2–5 cm (0.79–1.97 in) long, with the outer portion
      4–6 cm (1.6–2.4 in) diameter with five petals, resembling those of other
      related genera such as Plumeria and Nerium. The flowers tend to be red and
      pink, often with a whitish blush outward of the throat.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Uses:</h2>
    <p>
      Adenium obesum produces a sap in its roots and stems that contains cardiac
      glycosides. This sap is used as arrow poison for hunting large game
      throughout much of Africa and as a fish toxin.
