    <p>
      When we worship Lord Shiva, bel patra is one of the most important items
      offered. It is said that the leaves of bel patra are Lord Shiva’s
      favorite. The three-leaf bel patra symbolizes the Trinity: Brahma, Vishnu,
      and Mahesh (Shiva). According to the scriptures, the three leaves of bel
      patra also represent the three eyes of Lord Shiva.
