    <p>
      Alstonia scholaris is a glabrous tree and grows up to 40 m (130 ft) tall.
      Its mature bark is grayish and its young branches are copiously marked
      with lenticels. The upper side of the leaves are glossy, while the
      underside is greyish. Leaves occur in whorls of three to ten; petioles are
      13 cm (0.391.18 in); the leathery leaves are narrowly obovate to very
      narrowly spathulate, base cuneate, apex usually rounded; lateral veins
      occur in 25 to 50 pairs, at 8090 to midvein. Cymes are dense and
      pubescent; peduncle is 47 cm (1.62.8 in) long. Pedicels are usually as
      long as or shorter than calyx. The corolla is white and tube-like, 610 mm
      (0.240.39 in); lobes are broadly ovate or broadly obovate, 24.5 mm
      (0.0790.177 in), overlapping to the left. The ovaries are distinct and
      pubescent. The follicles are distinct and linear.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses:</h1>
    <p>
      During convocation the leaves of Alstonia scholaris (saptaparni) are
      awarded to graduates and postgraduates of Visva-Bharati University by the
      chancellor, given to him in turn by the Prime Minister of India. In recent
      years, supposedly to prevent excessive damage to environment, the vice
      chancellor of the University accepts one saptaparni leaf from the
      chancellor on behalf of all the students. This tradition was initiated by
      the founder of the University, Gurudeb Rabindranath Tagore.
