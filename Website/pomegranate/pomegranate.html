    <h1 class="heading">Introdution:</h1>
    <p>
      Pomegranate, Punica granatum, is a deciduous or evergreen tree or shrub in
      the family Punicaceae grown for its edible fruits. The pomegranate tree is
      branched and spiny with glossy, leathery, oval to oblong leaves that grow
      in whorls of five or more on the branches. The tree produces bright red
      flowers singly at the tips of the branches and a rounded hexagonal fruit
      with a thick pink-red skin. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind which
      protects the pulp[ and seeds inside. The inside of the fruit is separated
      into compartments by white spongy tissue. Each compartment contains seeds
      and pulp. Each pomegranate fruit may contain as many as 600 seeds.
      Pomegranate trees can reach a height of 10 m (33 ft) and can be very long
      lived, although their economic lifespan is usually between 12 and 15
      years. Pomegranate may also be referred to as grenadine or Chinese apple
      and originated from Central Asia, likely in Iran.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses:</h1>
    <p>
      Pomegranate is primarily eaten as a fresh fruit by splitting open the rind
      and consuming the seeds. The seeds may be used in salads. The fruit may
      also be used to produce juice, either by removing and pressing the seeds
      or by pressing the whole fruit.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Cultivation:</h1>
    <p>
      While the pomegranate is considered indigenous indigenous to Iran and
      neighbouring countries, its cultivation long ago encircled the
      Mediterranean and extended through the Arabian Peninsula, Afghanistan, and
      India. It is commonly cultivated in the Americas from the warmer parts of
      the United States to Chile. Though the pomegranate grows in a wide range
      of climates, good fruit is produced only where high temperatures and dry
      atmosphere accompany the ripening period. Deep, rather heavy loams appear
      to be the best soils. Seeds can readily be grown, but choice varieties are
      reproduced by cutting and layerings. Commercial propagation is performed
      by taking hardwood cuttings 250–300 mm (10–12 inches) long and rooting
      them in the open ground.
