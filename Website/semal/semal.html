      Bombax ceiba, like other trees of the genus Bombax, is commonly known as
      cotton tree. More specifically, it is sometimes known as Malabar
      silk-cotton tree; red silk-cotton; red cotton tree; or ambiguously as
      silk-cotton or kapok,[2] both of which may also refer to Ceiba pentandra.
      This Asian tropical tree has a straight tall trunk and its leaves are
      deciduous in winter. Red flowers with 5 petals appear in the spring before
      the new foliage.[3] It produces a capsule which, when ripe, contains white
      fibres like cotton. Its trunk bears spikes to deter attacks by animals.
      Although its stout trunk suggests that it is useful for timber, its wood
      is too soft to be very useful.

      The white fluffy fibres are carded into thread and woven into textiles in
      Nepal and India. In North India, the fibers are also used in pillows. In
      Thailand, the dry cores of the Bombax ceiba flower are an essential
      ingredient of the nam ngiao spicy noodle soup of the cuisine of Shan State
      and Northern Thailand, as well as the kaeng khae curry. Its flower buds
      known as "Marathi Moggu" are also used in regional cuisine of Southern
      India as a spice as well as in herbal medicine.[citation needed] Bombax
      ceiba is literally known as “cotton-tree flowers” in Cantonese. It plays a
      vital role in Southern Chinese, especially Cantonese, culture. It is also
      the official flower of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in
      southern China. With some trees flowering from late February to early May.
      Fruiting can start as early as March. At the peak of its flowering season,
      elderly people may often be seen gathering the fallen flowers from the
      ground to dry, which they later use to prepare tea or soup. The flowers
      are very attractive to local wildlife, with many birds like the Japanese
      white-eye, a type of fruit eating bird, which often draws a hole in an
      unopened Bombax ceiba flower bud. Honey bees, and bumble bees also
      attracted to the flowers to collect pollen and nectar. Because the flowers
      attract many insects, crab spiders can be occasionally found on a fully
      opened flower, hunting bees.
