    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Kadam, with English common names burflower-tree, laran, and Leichhardt
      pine,[2] and called kadam or cadamba locally, is an evergreen, tropical
      tree native to South and Southeast Asia. The genus name honours French
      naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. It has scented orange flowers in dense
      globe-shaped clusters. The flowers are used in perfumes. The tree is grown
      as an ornamental plant and for timber and paper-making. Kadam features in
      Indian religions and mythologies.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Description:</h2>
    <p>
      A fully mature tree can reach up to 45 m (148 ft) in height. It is a large
      tree with a broad crown and straight cylindrical bole. It is quick
      growing, with broad spreading branches and grows rapidly in the first 6–8
      years. The trunk has a diameter of 100–160 cm, but typically less than
      that. Leaves are 13–32 cm (5.1–12.6 in) long. Flowering usually begins
      when the tree is 4–5 years old. Its flowers are sweetly fragrant, red to
      orange in colour, occurring in dense, globular heads of approximately 5.5
      cm (2.2 in) diameter. The fruit of N. cadamba occur in small, fleshy
      capsules packed closely together to form a fleshy yellow-orange
      infructescence containing approximately 8000 seeds. On maturing, the fruit
      splits apart, releasing the seeds, which are then dispersed by wind or
      rain.

        It sheds large amounts of leaf and non-leaf litter which on
        decomposition improves some physical and chemical properties of soil
        under its canopy.
