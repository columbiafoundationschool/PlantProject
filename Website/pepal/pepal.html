    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The peepal tree is considered the mythical ‘Tree of Life’ or ‘World Tree’
      of the Indian subcontinent. The peepal tree, also called Ficus religiosa,
      belonging to the family Moraceae, is a variation of the fig tree known as
      the bodhi tree. The word ‘Ficus’ in Latin refers to ‘fig’, the fruit of
      the tree and the word ‘Religiosa’ refers to ‘religion’, as it is sacred in
      both Buddhism and Hinduism. Also, for this reason, it is named ‘Sacred
      fig’. It is a huge tree often planted near holy places and temples.1
