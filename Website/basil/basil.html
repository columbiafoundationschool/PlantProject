    <h1 class="heading">Introducion</h1>
    <p>
        Thai basil (Ocimum basilicum var. thyrsiflora) is a member of the mint family and as such has a particular sweet
        flavor reminiscent of anise, licorice, and clove. Popular among the cuisines of Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and
        Cambodia, growing Thai basil has a pleasing aroma similar to sweet basil and is generally used fresh in recipes.
        Also referred to as ‘Sweet Thai,’ Thai basil plants grow to a height of between 12 to 18 inches (30.5-45.5 cm.)
        with leaves 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm.) long on purple stems with purple flowers. Like sweet basil, Thai basil
        is a perennial.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Physical description</h1>
    <p>
        Thai basil is sturdy and compact, growing up to 45 cm (1 ft 6 in), and has shiny green, slightly serrated,
        narrow leaves with a sweet, anise-like scent and hints of licorice, along with a slight spiciness lacking in
        sweet basil. Thai basil has a purple stem, and like other plants in the mint family, the stem is square. Its
        leaves are opposite and decussate. As implied by its scientific name, Thai basil flowers in the form of a
        thyrse. The inflorescence is purple, and the flowers when open are pink.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Uses of basil:</h1>
    <p>
        Now that you have harvested the basil, what are you going to do with it? Some Thai basil uses are to infuse with
        vinegar or oil, to flavor Pho with mint and chilies, make tea, or pair with almost any chicken, pork, or beef
        dish. Recipes online include one for making Thai basil beer and a recipe for Thai basil pesto with peanuts, rice
        vinegar, fish sauce, and sesame oil, which will keep in the refrigerator for a week. Yum! Thai basil is usually
        used fresh, preferably soon after harvesting, but you can also chop it up or run it through a food processor and
        freeze it in ice cube trays. Once frozen, remove from the tray and store in resealable bags in the freezer for
        up to two months. Thai basil may also be used as an aromatherapy treatment by bruising the leaves and inhaling
        their aroma. They can also be bruised and rubbed beneath the eyes and on the forehead for a relaxing reprieve
        from a long, stressful day.
