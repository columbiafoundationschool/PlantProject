    <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Not only are grapes wonderful for eating, juicing, and winemaking, but
      they are also a beautiful ornamental plant. Grapevines should be planted
      in early spring and typically harvested in later summer and early fall.
      Remember that pruning your grapes in late winter is important, too. See
      how to grow grapes. Grape vines not only produce sweet and versatile
      fruits, they add an element of drama to a garden or landscape. They are
      vigorous growers, and with the proper pruning, they will produce fruit
      with ease within a few years and last for 30 years or more. For home
      gardeners, there are three main types of grapes to consider: American
      (Vitis labrusca), European (V. vinifera), and French-American hybrids.
      American grapes are the most cold-hardy, while European grapes—usually
      better for wine than the table—do well in warm, dry, Mediterranean-type
      zones. Hybrids tend to be both cold-hardy and disease-resistant, but are
      not as flavorful as European grapes. Another type that is grown in the
      U.S. is the Muscadine (V. rotundifolia), which is native to the southern
      United States. The Muscadine grape’s thick skin make it best suited for
      use in jams, wine, or other processed grape products.

    <h2 class="subHeading">Planting</h2>
    <p>
      Grapevines should be planted in early spring after the date of the last
      hard freeze has past. Vines are usually purchased as dormant, bare-root
      plants. Most grape varieties are self-fertile. To be sure, ask when you
      are buying vines if you will need more than one plant for pollination.
      Select a site with full sun. If you don’t have a spot with full sun, make
      sure it at least gets morning sun. A small amount of afternoon shade won’t
      hurt. Your soil needs to be deep, well-drained, and loose. You also need
      good air circulation. Grape vines will need to be trained to some sort of
      support to grow upward. This will also cut the risk of disease. The
      support needs to be in place at planting.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheaing">Growing</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Do not fertilize in the first year unless you have problem soil.
        Fertilize lightly in the second year of growth.
      </li>
      <li>Use mulch to keep an even amount of moisture around the vines.</li>
      <li>A mesh net is useful in keeping birds away from budding fruit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subHeading">Harvesting</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        If grapes aren’t ripening, pinch back some of the foliage to let in more
        sunlight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grapes will not continue ripening once picked from the vine. Test a few
        to see if they are to your liking before harvesting, usually in late
        summer or early fall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grapes are ripe and ready to harvest when they are rich in color, juicy,
        full-flavored, easily crushed but not shriveled, and plump. They should
        be tightly attached to the stems. Sample different grapes from different
        clusters, and the taste should be between sweet and tart. Check our
        ripeness guide for more tips on color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grapes can be stored for up to six weeks in the cellar, but grapes can
        absorb the odors of other fruits and vegetables, so keep them separate.
        Use cardboard boxes or crates lined with clean, dry straw. Separate
        bunches with straw or sawdust. Check often for spoilage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subHeading">Pruning Grapes:</h2>
    <p>
      Pruning is very important. Grapes produce fruit on shoots growing off of
      one-year-old canes. If you have too many old canes (from no pruning), then
      you’ll get fewer grapes. If you prune back your vines completely each
      year, then you get lots of new growth, but again, few grapes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subHeading">Latex:</h3>
    <p>
      he leaves of the fig tree contain a milky white compound in it which is
      known as Latex. This latex can usually be used in making a host of rubber
      products.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subHeading">Yellowing Of Leaves:</h3>
    <p>
      You may find your fig tree’s leaves turning yellow. This is the result of
      poor soil and under-feeding. You should pay attention to the quality of
      the soil while the soil is changing at least once per year if potted.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subhheading">Loss Of Leaves:</h3>
    <p>
      Your fig tree may lose its leaves, and it may occur when you over-water.
      The low temperature, low light, or not paying attention to the re-potting
      could also cause the leave shedding.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subHeading">Pests:</h3>
    <p>
      If you find your fig tree covered with the pests, immediately spray the
      pesticide on the leaves. The treatment will depend on the peat so consult
      an arborist for more specific information.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subHeading">Brown Spots On Leaves:</h3>
    <p>
      If you found brown spots on the fig tree leaves due to cold temperatures.
      If notice brown spots beginning to develop, immediately move your plant to
      a warmer part of the house with a bit more light. Direct light hitting the
      pot of the plant and not the leaves would be ideal.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeading">Note:</h2>
    <p>
      The latex of the fig tree can be poisonous to humans and pets. It can also
      cause vomits or diarrhea if taken internally. The fruit is the only part
      that is used internally.

        <h3>If you are growing grapes on an arbor or trellis:</h3> Grow the
        grapes, one per post, selecting the strongest cane. Allow it to grow to
        the top of the post the first year, securing it to the post as it grows.
        The first winter top the cane and allow it to grow side branches along
        the top of the arbor. If you let the vines just continue to grow, they
        will produce dense shade, but little fruit. Prune the grapes each winter
        by removing those canes that fruited the previous year, cutting back
        one-year-old canes to five to six buds, and leaving some renewal canes
        pruned back to two to three buds. The goal is to have canes on the
        trellis spaced 2 to 3 feet apart. Remove any weak, thin canes. You want
        to leave enough fruiting canes on the trellis to fill it back in each
        summer, but not so many that is becomes a tangled mess.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>If you are growing grapes on a stake:</h3> Cut back the side canes in
        the first winter to three buds on each. These will send out shoots that
        will produce grapes the next year. Remove all weak and spindly growth,
        especially along the lower parts of the trunk. The second winter, prune
        back the healthiest canes to six to ten buds, select two canes as
        renewal spurs and prune those back to three buds on each and remove all
        other canes. Repeat this pruning each winter. Your trunk should be able
        to support four to seven fruiting canes each year as it gets older.
