    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
      Ficus is a genus of about 850 species of woody trees, shrubs, vines,
      epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in the family Moraceae. Collectively known as
      fig trees or figs, they are native throughout the tropics with a few
      species extending into the semi-warm temperate zone. The common fig (F.
      carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia and the
      Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan to Portugal), which has been widely
      cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as figs. The
      fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of
      only local economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are
      extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of
      considerable cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects
      of worship and for their many practical uses.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description:</h1>
    <p>
      Ficus is a pantropical genus of trees, shrubs, and vines occupying a wide
      variety of ecological niches; most are evergreen, but some deciduous
      species are found in areas outside of the tropics and to higher
      elevations. Fig species are characterized by their unique inflorescence
      and distinctive pollination syndrome, which uses wasp species belonging to
      the family Agaonidae for pollination. Specific identification of many of
      the species can be difficult, but members of the genus Ficus are
      relatively easy to recognize. Many have aerial roots and a distinctive
      shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The
      fruit of Ficus is an inflorescence enclosed in an urn-like structure
      called a syconium, which is lined on the inside with the fig's tiny
      flowers that develop into multiple ovaries.

    <p>
      Figs are keystone species in many tropical forest ecosystems. Their fruit
      are a key resource for some frugivores including fruit bats, and primates
      including: capuchin monkeys, langurs, gibbons and mangabeys. They are even
      more important for birds such as Asian barbets, pigeons, hornbills,
      fig-parrots and bulbuls, which may almost entirely subsist on figs when
      these are in plenty. Many Lepidoptera caterpillars feed on fig leaves, for
      example several Euploea species (crow butterflies), the plain tiger
      (Danaus chrysippus), the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes), the
      brown awl (Badamia exclamationis), and Chrysodeixis eriosoma, Choreutidae
      and Copromorphidae moths. The citrus long-horned beetle (Anoplophora
      chinensis), for example, has larvae that feed on wood, including that of
      fig trees; it can become a pest in fig plantations. Similarly, the sweet
      potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is frequently found as a pest on figs
      grown as potted plants and is spread through the export of these plants to
      other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see
      List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae).
