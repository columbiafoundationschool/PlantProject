    <p>
      Hoya bella, the beautiful hoya, waxflower or pretty waxflower, is a
      species of tropical epiphyte with trailing stems, slightly succulent
      leaves and pendant umbels of fragrant, white and purple flowers. It is an
      asclepiad in the periwinkle and milkweed family, Apocynaceae.

      As the plant is easy and fast from cuttings, the price came down quickly.
      On the 24th of October 1850, Thomas Appleby (Floricultural Manager of
      Messrs Henderson, Edgeware-road in London) wrote that "The price for
      tolerable good plants is 7s. 6d.". He also wrote that "As the H.
      imperialis is one of the most noble of the noble plants, so this is the
      prettiest of all the pretty ones."

      The Cornish plant collector Thomas Lobb found plants of Hoya bella growing
      on trees on a hill near Moulmein, then the capital of British Burma. Lobb
      shipped the live plants to his employers, Messrs. Veitch and Son of
      Exeter. Kew Gardens consider that the plant is also native to Manipur in
      northeast India on the border of Myanmar.
