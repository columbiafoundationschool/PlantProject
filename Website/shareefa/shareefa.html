    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
      Annona reticulata is a small deciduous or semi-evergreen tree in the plant
      family Annonaceae and part of the Annonas group. It is best known for its
      fruit, called custard apple, a common name shared with fruits of several
      other species in the same genus: A. cherimola and A. squamosa. Other
      English common names include ox heart and bullock's heart. In India, it is
      commonly known as Ramphal in Hindi and aater in Konkani (a regional
      language native to the state of Goa). The fruit is sweet and useful in
      preparation of desserts, but is generally less popular for eating than
      that of A. cherimola.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Description</h1>
    <p>
      It is a small deciduous or semi-evergreen tree reaching 8 metres (26 ft)
      to 10 metres (33 ft) tall with an open, irregular crown. The slender
      leaves are hairless, straight and pointed at the apex (in some varieties
      wrinkled), 10 centimetres (3.9 in) to 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long and 2
      centimetres (0.79 in) to 7 centimetres (2.8 in) wide. The yellow-green
      flowers are generally in clusters of three or four 2 centimetres (0.79 in)
      to 3 centimetres (1.2 in) diameter, with three long outer petals and three
      very small inner ones. Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads. The fruits
      vary in shape, heart-shaped, spherical, oblong or irregular. The size
      ranges from 7 centimetres (2.8 in) to 12 centimetres (4.7 in), depending
      on the cultivar. When ripe, the fruit is brown or yellowish, with red
      highlights and a varying degree of reticulation, depending again on the
      variety. The flesh varies from juicy and very aromatic to hard with a
      repulsive taste. The flavor is sweet and pleasant, akin to the taste of
      'traditional' custard.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Cultivation</h1>
    <p>
      Seeds can be propagated. Other techniques for cultivation are grafting and
      budding. The tree produces 45 kg of fruits per year. In Asia, the season
      lasts from July to September, and in the Caribbean, it runs from February
      to April.
