    <p>
      Jasmine (taxonomic name: Jasminum is a genus of shrubs and vines in the
      olive family (Oleaceae). It contains around 200 species native to tropical
      and warm temperate regions of Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Jasmines are
      widely cultivated for the characteristic fragrance of their flowers. A
      number of unrelated plants contain the word "jasmine" in their common
      names.

      Jasmine can be either deciduous(leaves falling in autumn) or
      evergreen(green all year round), and can be erect, spreading, or climbing
      shrubs and vines Their leaves are borne in opposing or alternating
      arrangement and can be of simple, trifoliate, or pinnate formation. The
      flowers are typically around 2.5 cm in diameter. They are white or yellow,
      although in rare instances they can be slightly reddish. The flowers are
      borne in cymose clusters with a minimum of three flowers, though they can
      also be solitary on the ends of branchlets. Each flower has about four to
      nine petels, two locules, and one to four ovules. They have two stamens

      Jasmine is cultivated commercially for domestic and industrial uses, such
      as the perfume industry. It is used in rituals like marriages, religious
      ceremonies, and festivals. Jasmine flower vendors sell garlands of
      jasmine, or in the case of the thicker motiyaa or mograa varieties,
      bunches of jasmine are common. They may be found around entrances to
      temples, on major thoroughfares, and in major business areas. A change in
      presidency in Tunisia in 1987 and the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 are both
      called “Jasmine revolutions” in reference to the flower.
