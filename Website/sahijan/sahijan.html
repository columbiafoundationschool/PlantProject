    <p>
      Sahijan (Moringa) is a plant that is native to the sub-Himalayan areas of
      India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan but currently is also grown
      throughout the tropics. The leaves, bark, flowers, fruit, seeds, and root
      are used to make medicine. Traditionally, Moringa is used for “tired
      blood” (anemia); arthritis and other joint pain (rheumatism); asthma;
      cancer; constipation; diabetes; diarrhea; epilepsy; stomach pain; stomach
      and intestinal ulcers; intestinal spasms; headache; heart problems; high
      blood pressure; kidney stones; fluid retention; thyroid disorders; and
      bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections.
