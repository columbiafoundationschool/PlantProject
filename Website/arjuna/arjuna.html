    <p>
      The name Arjuna is mostly related to the warrior prince in Mahabharata but
      for those familiar with Ayurvedic medicine, it is also an effective herbal
      medicine.  Belonging to the Combretaceae family, with the Latin name is
      Terminalia Arjuna, this reddish bark of the plant is highly valued for
      its medicinal properties. In India, Arjuna is one of the most sacred
      trees, where the leaves and flowers are offered to Lord Vishnu and Lord
      Ganesha.

      When taken in measured doses, arjuna bark powders and infused formulations
      are very safe for internal consumption and do not pose any health hazards.

      concoctions can lead to health issues in the stomach, liver and kidneys.
