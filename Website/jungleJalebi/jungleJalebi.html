    <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Pithecellobium dulce, also known as Samania saman, and commonly known as
      Manila tamarind, Madras thorn, Monkeypod Tree or camachile, is a species
      of flowering plant in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to the
      Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands of Mexico, Central America, and
      northern South America. It is also sometimes known as monkeypod, but that
      name is also used for several other plants, including Samanea saman. It is
      an introduced species and extensively naturalized in the Caribbean and
      Florida, as well as the Philippines and Guam via the Manila galleons. It
      has also been introduced to Thailand and South Asia. It is considered an
      invasive species in Hawaii.

    <h1 class="heading">Description</h1>
    <p>
      Pithecellobium dulce is a tree that reaches a height of about 10 to 15 m
      (33 to 49 ft). Its trunk is spiny and up to nine meters in girth (9.4 feet
      thick DBH) and its leaves are bipinnate. Each pinna has a single pair of
      ovate-oblong leaflets that are about 2 to 4 cm (0.79 to 1.57 in) long. The
      flowers are greenish-white, fragrant, sessile and reach about 12 cm (4.7
      in) in length, though appear shorter due to coiling. The flowers produce a
      pod, which turns pink when ripe and opens to expose the seed arils; a pink
      or white, edible pulp. The pulp contains black shiny seeds that are
      circular and flat. Pollen is a polyad of many pollen grains stitched
      together.

    <h1 class="heading">Vernacular names</h1>
    <p>
      The English names "Manila tamarind" and "Madras thorn" are both misleading
      since it is neither related to the tamarind nor native to Manila (though
      it was introduced early to the Philippines) or Madras. Other English names
      include blackbead, sweet Inga, and monkeypod. Depending on the region of
      its occurrence, Pithecellobium dulce is known by different names. In its
      native Mexico, the tree is known as huamuche, guamuche, huamchil,
      guamchil, or cuamchil, deriving from its Nahuatl name cuauhmochitl. The
      Nahuatl derivations are also preserved in its names in the Philippines,
      where it was first introduced into Asia via the Manila galleons. It is
      known as kamachile in Tagalog (from where the English name "camachile" is
      derived), kamunsil in Hiligaynon, and damortis or kamantiris in IIokano.
      In the wider region of Latin America, it is also called pinzn, or guam
      americano (Puerto Rico). In Colombia it is known as chiminango and
      payand. It is also known as Ê»opiuma in (Hawaiian). In South Asia and the
      rest of Southeast Asia, it is known by many names, most of which literally
      translate to "foreign tamarind". These include: makham thet in Thai; plaeh
      umpel tek in khmer; kodukkappuli or kodikallaka in; seema chintakaya in
      Telugu; dora hunase or seeme hunase in Kannada; bakhai ambli or goras
      ambli in Gujarat; vilayati chinch or chinch bilai or cheese bilai in
      Marathi; jungle jalebi in seema Kaiyan in Odia; achhi gidamiri in Sindhi;
      and jilapi in Bengali. In Pakistan, it is also known as "jungle jalebi",
      after the resemblance of its fruits to the jalebi.
