    <h1 class="heading">What is Neem?</h1>
    <p>
      Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, nimtree or Indian lilac, is a
      tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the
      genus Azadirachta, and is native to the Indian subcontinent and most of
      the countries in Africa. It is typically grown in tropical and
      semi-tropical regions. Neem trees also grow on islands in southern Iran.
      Its fruits and seeds are the source of neem oil. Neem is a fast-growing
      tree that can reach a height of 15 to 20 metres (49 to 66 ft), and rarely
      35 to 40 m (115 to 131 ft). It is deciduous, shedding many of its leaves
      during the dry winter months. The branches are wide and spreading. The
      fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of 20 to 25 m (66
      to 82 ft). The neem tree is similar in appearance to its relative, the
      chinaberry (Melia azedarach). The neem tree is often confused with a
      similar looking tree called bakain. Bakain also has toothed leaflets and
      similar looking fruit. One difference is that neem leaves are pinnate but
      bakain leaves are twice- and thrice-pinnate.

    <h1 class="heading">Uses of neem</h1>
    <h2 class="subHeading">1. Phytochemicals</h2>
    <p>
      Neem fruit, seeds, leaves, stems, and bark contain diverse phytochemicals,
      some of which were first discovered in azadirachta seed extracts, such as
      azadirachtin established in the 1960s as an insect antifeedant, growth
      disruptor, and insecticide. The yield of azadirachtin from crushing 2 kg
      of seeds is about 5g. In addition to azadirachtin and related limonoids,
      the seed oil contains glycerides, diverse polyphenols, nimbolide,
      triterpenes, and beta-sitosterol. The yellow, bitter oil has a garlic-like
      odor and contains about 2% of limonoid compounds.[11] The leaves contain
      quercetin, catechins, carotenes, and vitamin C.

    <h2 class="subHeading">2. Traditional medicine</h2>
    <p>
      Products made from neem trees have been used in the traditional medicine
      of India for centuries, but there is insufficient clinical evidence to
      indicate any benefits of using neem for medicinal purposes. In adults, no
      specific doses have been established, and short-term use of neem appears
      to be safe, while long-term use may harm the kidneys or liver; in small
      children, neem oil is toxic and can lead to death. Neem may also cause
      miscarriages, infertility, and low blood sugar.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeading">3. Pest and disease control</h2>
    <p>
      Neem is a key ingredient in non-pesticidal management (NPM), providing a
      natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. Neem seeds are ground into
      powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed on the crop. To be
      effective, it must be applied repeatedly, at least every ten days. Neem
      does not directly kill insects. It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and
      egg-laying deterrent and thus protects the crop from damage. The insects
      starve and die within a few days. Neem also suppresses the subsequent
      hatching of their eggs. Neem-based fertilizers have been effective against
      southern armyworm. Neem cake may be used as a fertilizer. Neem oil has
      been shown to avert termite attack as an ecofriendly and economical agent.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHeading">4. Neem oil for polymeric resins</h2>
    <p>
      Applications of neem oil in the preparation of polymeric resins have been
      documented in recent reports. The synthesis of various alkyd resins from
      neem oil is reported using a monoglyceride (MG) route and their
      utilization for the preparation of PU coatings. The alkyds are prepared
      from reaction of conventional divalent acid materials like phthalic and
      maleic anhydrides with MG of neem oil.

    <h2 class="subHeading">5. Other uses</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li class="listItems">Tree: the neem tree is of great importance for its anti-desertification properties and possibly as a good carbon
        dioxide sink. It is also used for maintaining soil fertility.</li class="listItems">
      <li class="listItems">Fertilizer: neem extract is added to fertilizers (urea) as a nitrification inhibitor.</li class="listItems">
      <li class="listItems">Animal feed: neem leaves can be occasionally used as forage for ruminants and rabbits.</li class="listItems">
      <li class="listItems">Teeth cleaning:n eem has traditionally been used as a type of teeth-cleaning twig.</li class="listItems">
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading">Safety issues</h1>
    <p>
      Neem oil has the ability to cause some forms of toxic enecephalopathy and ophthalmopathy if consumed in any
      quantity.
