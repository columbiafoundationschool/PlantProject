    <h1 class="heading">Introduction:</h1>
    <p>
      Guava is a common tropical fruit cultivated in many tropical and
      subtropical regions. The common guava Psidium guajava (lemon guava, apple
      guava) is a small tree in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), native to Mexico,
      Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. The name guava
      is also given to some other species in the genus Psidium such as
      strawberry guava (Psidium cattleyanum) and to the pineapple guava, Feijoa
      sellowiana. In 2019, 55 million tonnes of guavas were produced worldwide,
      led by India with 45% of the total. Botanically, guavas are berries.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Types of Guava:</h1>
    <p>
      The most frequently eaten species, and the one often simply referred to as
      "the guava", is the apple guava (Psidium guajava). Guavas are typical
      Myrtoideae, with tough dark heavy leaves that are opposite, simple,
      elliptic to ovate, and 5–15 centimetres (2–6 in) long. The flowers are
      white, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruits are many-seeded
      berries.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subHeading">Fruit</h1>
    <p>
      Guava fruits, usually 4 to 12 centimetres long, are round or oval
      depending on the species. They have a pronounced and typical fragrance,
      similar to lemon rind but less sharp. The outer skin may be rough, often
      with a bitter taste, or soft and sweet. Varying between species, the skin
      can be any thickness, is usually green before maturity, but may be yellow,
      maroon, or green when ripe. The pulp inside may be sweet or sour and
      off-white ("white" guavas) to deep pink ("red" guavas). The seeds in the
      central pulp vary in number and hardness, depending on species.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Production:</h1>
    <p>
      In 2019, world production of guavas was 55 million tonnes, led by India
      with 45% of the total (table). Other major producers were China and
      Thailand.

    <h1 class="subHeading">Culinary uses</h1>
    <p>
      In Mexico and other Latin American countries, the popular beverage agua
      fresca is often made with guava. The entire fruit is a key ingredient in
      punch, and the juice is often used in culinary sauces (hot or cold), ales,
      candies, dried snacks, fruit bars, and desserts, or dipped in chamoy.
      Pulque de guayaba ("guayaba" is Spanish for guava) is a popular alcoholic
      beverage in these regions.
